# Syncing content from Notion

This is work in progress, the building blocks are there but I haven't completed
the config (API token, pages in Notion).

Content that is maintained in Notion doesn't need to be committed to git. 
In fact, committing it to git would probably just confuse things. 
So commit special pages, such as e.g. the frontpage if it has special layout,
as e.g. `./content/pages/frontpage.html` and enlist developer support in
updating it.

In order to retrieve pages from Notion on your machine, install the API
and configure the API key:

```bash
pip install --user notion
export NOTION_BLOG_POSTS_PAGE=https://www.notion.so/pyconth/News-08d5aa2f573348e1b96671488947f997
export NOTION_TOKEN=...
```

Grab the API key from your browser session (see https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py#quickstart).
