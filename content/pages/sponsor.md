### Theme : Our Python . Our Future

We believe that nurturing and supporting young programmers is the key to a sustainable Python community.

PyCon Thailand is proud to be hosting PyCon APAC in 2021! We adopt "Our Python. Our Future" as the theme for 2021 steering towards education for the younger generation. We believe it's essential to create an accessible learning pathway for discovering new Python uses across industries.

With COVID-19 restrictions and limited travel abilities, PyCon APAC will be going hybrid to provide both local and global attendees an opportunity to meet and interact among the Python community in Asia-Pacific.

## PyCon APAC

PyCon APAC is the Python conference for countries in the Asia Pacific and Australasia region, including countries that do not organize their own PyCon conference. Unlike PyCon US and EuroPython where the number of participants are more stable, the number of participants at PyCon APAC varies depending on the hosting country. The following is an estimate of past PyCon APAC's:

- 200+ participants in PyCon APAC (Singapore)
- 500+ participants in PyCon APAC (Tokyo, Japan)
- 700+ participants in PyCon APAC (Taipei, Taiwan)

The main medium of communication in PyCon APAC is also dependent on the hosting country.
PyCon Thailand is proud to be the host in 2021.

### The Format

Hybrid or 100% online ( to be confirmed 4 months before event)

6-day full-featured Programme

The most important thing about PyCon is the people. It’s the opportunity to meet, talk and learn from one another and to find inspiration and motivation. To allow attendees enjoy the event at their own convenience, all talks will be released at the same time each day while Q&A will be broadcast live after attendees had ample time to watch the talks. Attendees will have plenty of time for discussion with the speakers, sponsors, partners and other attendees in the lounge and rooms.
The conference will have several tracks sorted according to theme with more than 50 talks and lightning talks spread over 2 days.



## A more APAC oriented PyCon

PyCon Thailand has been the largest annual international conference for the community using and developing the open-source Python programming language in Thailand. 

Driven by the members of the Python Community in Bangkok on a non-profit basis dedicated to advancing and promoting Python.

Hosting PyCon APAC will mean a larger  and broader audience. With social distancing put into place around the world, many organisers around Asia has cancelled their conferences or postponed them including PyCon TH in 2020. We have invited several PyCon organisers this year to contribute and invite speakers from their country to participate in hopes to create a more APAC content PyCon this year.  Putting all these in place will take a tremendous amount of time and budget to make it happen

Your sponsorship helps keep PyCon affordable and accessible to the widest possible audience.

### Community Building Sponsorship

**30,000THB ( Approx. 990USD)**

The community building support sponsors will help us fund the health track providing talks and activities related to developers' physical, mental and emotional health. Specialists and experts will be invited to lead these sessions.

Programming can be a stressful job because of its tight deadlines, often unrealistic client expectations, and because programmers feel pressure to continuously upgrade their skills. This all generates anxiety, which can ultimately lead to burnout especially during this period where many people are experiencing lockdown stress.

We believe that supporting the community means not only providing knowledge on Python related topics but also mental and physical health knowledge.
