Several of the open source libraries included are Prefect, MLFlow, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, FastAPI, pandas, and the HoloViz suite of libraries.

To avoid wasting time, we help you discover the pros and cons of each. You&rsquo;ll see a side by side comparison of features that will empower you to feel productive in your development quest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;All the cool kids are using FastAPI for API development.&rdquo; Imagine hearing this just as you start getting more comfortable using other frameworks, like Python&rsquo;s Django or Flask, to build out your APIs. Folks, there&rsquo;s a new kid on the block! In this talk, there&rsquo;s going to be an epic face-off between FastAPI and Flask.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is Flask?<\/strong> <br \/>Flask is a micro web framework built for Python designed to get your application up and running quickly. It&rsquo;s lightweight and used by many different well-known projects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What is FastAPI?<\/strong> <br \/>FastAPI (aka the new kid) is a modern Python web framework that takes all your favorite features from other tools and combines them into one. It was built for speed, rapid development, and enhanced developer experience.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ll do a side-by-side comparison of the two frameworks, including features and code structure, using a REST API.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>By the end of the face-off, you&rsquo;ll have a much better understanding of which one you&rsquo;ll use in your next project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s analyze the pros and cons of each and why you&rsquo;d use one over the other. You may even find a lot of similarities between the two and some contrast as well. You&rsquo;ll see different categories of features for the frameworks, and a winner will be chosen for each.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Finally, no matter which you prefer, FastAPI and Flask are both great choices for API development, so let&rsquo;s have fun and let the face-off begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Questions for Tonya?

        "description":"<p>Posture is not something we care too much about until we get hit with back-pain. Back pain can be seen as a rite of passage of getting old, welcome to the club, etc. It would surprise many to find that posture and back pain are not directly in causation. <br \/><br \/>When we think about posture, we often think about the negative aspects of it and how it relates to our lives (i.e. poor posture leading to a forward head, round shoulders, sway back). Posture plays an important role in our day-to-day activities, but it is not the main problem we face when we are sitting all day in front of the computer. <br \/><br \/>The main problem is that we do not have time to exercise, to move about, or to treat movement as vital to our well-being. Work takes precedence and for some people, exercise and movement are just not part of the daily routine. Habits are hard to change, and routine hard to establish if it is not necessary or fun. <br \/>The first step is therefore to understand the obstacles to change. Why do we not move more? What or who is stopping you from taking a physically active break while at work (is it really just the boss)? <br \/>The second step is to then figure out your back pain. Understanding back pain can be a minefield. Pain is probably not what you think is going on. That MRI scan that you have just been ordered to get by your physician may tell you that your back is broken: e.g. disc bulge at L5\/S1. There are a lot of people that will tell you what is wrong from a scan, but the truth is they cannot (taken from The New Scientist 31\/08\/2019). Besides being incredibly expensive and a waste of time, getting an MRI scan may actually worsen your back pain, as once you start looking for abnormalities, you will find them. <br \/>Finally, you are left with either making a lifestyle change or going in for back surgery (or both). Seek an expert to give you guidance, support, and accountability to making the lifestyle changes. Always remember that pain is not what you think is going on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Questions for Ben?

As contributors, we rely on contributing guides in order to get onboarded and start contributing to the project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Whereas, in my 15+ years of working in the tech industry, I&rsquo;ve seen teams and private organizations do poorly at technical documentation. The teams either did not have technical documentation at all, or they did not know how to do it well. If there&rsquo;s any documentation, it would be unmaintained and out of date. Open source collaboration is fascinating. As a professional software engineer and volunteer open source contributor, I get to learn the best from both worlds. In the past year, my team has been working towards building a culture of documentation by learning from best practises in the open source community.
